2. Do a final Phase 1 “review like a hiring manager” pass

1. Add pictures:

Love this step. **Screenshot curation is where your repo stops looking like “a lab” and starts looking like documentation.** Most people skip this — you won’t.

I’ll break this into:

1. **What screenshots to include**
2. **Where to put them**
3. **How to name them**
4. **How to reference them in Markdown**
5. **What screenshots NOT to include**

## 1️⃣ What Screenshots to Include (Signal > Volume)

You want **proof points**, not a photo dump.

### ✅ MUST-HAVE Screenshots (Phase 1)

### 🔹 Architecture

**Location:** `architecture/screenshots/`

* `proxmox-overview.png`

  * Proxmox dashboard showing all VMs
* `opnsense-interfaces.png`

  * WAN/LAN interfaces with IPs visible
* `opnsense-firewall-rules.png`

  * A clean ruleset showing allow/deny logic

---

### 🔹 Networking

**Location:** `phase-1-foundation/screenshots/networking/`

* `opnsense-aliases.png`

  * Network / host / port aliases
* `opnsense-rule-tiers.png`

  * Rules showing Tier-based enforcement

---

### 🔹 Active Directory

**Location:** `phase-1-foundation/screenshots/active-directory/`

* `aduc-tiered-ou.png`

  * Your Tier 0 / 1 / 2 OU structure
* `gpmc-baselines.png`

  * GPO baselines applied per tier
* `dc01-dns-config.png`

  * AD DNS role (optional but strong)

---

### 🔹 Virtualization

**Location:** `phase-1-foundation/screenshots/virtualization/`

* `proxmox-bridges.png`

  * vmbr0 / vmbr1 configuration
* `proxmox-backup-server.png`

  * PBS dashboard
* `golden-images.png`

  * Templates listed (admin + client)

---

## 2️⃣ Folder Structure (Clean + Scalable)

```
architecture/
└── screenshots/
    ├── proxmox-overview.png
    ├── opnsense-interfaces.png
    └── opnsense-firewall-rules.png

phase-1-foundation/
└── screenshots/
    ├── networking/
    ├── active-directory/
    └── virtualization/
```

This matches how enterprises store design evidence.

---

## 3️⃣ Screenshot Naming Rules (Important)

**Rule of thumb:**

> If the filename alone explains the screenshot, you did it right.

### ✅ Good

* `opnsense-aliases.png`
* `aduc-tiered-ou.png`
* `gpmc-baselines.png`

### ❌ Bad

* `Screenshot_2026-02-07.png`
* `image1.png`
* `final-final2.png`

---

## 4️⃣ How to Reference Screenshots in Markdown

Never just dump screenshots at the bottom. Always explain **what the reader should notice**.

### Example: `active-directory.md`

```md
### Tiered OU Structure
The Active Directory OU hierarchy is organized by administrative tier to enforce privilege separation.

![Tiered OU Structure](screenshots/active-directory/aduc-tiered-ou.png)
```

### Example: `networking.md`

```md
### Firewall Aliases
Aliases are used to simplify firewall rule management and reduce complexity.

![OPNsense Aliases](screenshots/networking/opnsense-aliases.png)
```

---

## 5️⃣ What to Crop / Blur

You should:

* Crop out browser tabs
* Crop excess UI chrome
* Blur:

  * Public IPs
  * Usernames if personal
  * Any secrets

You **do not** need to blur:

* RFC1918 IPs (192.168.x.x)
* Hostnames
* VM names

---

## 6️⃣ What NOT to Include (Common Mistakes)

❌ Every firewall rule
❌ Every GPO setting
❌ VM hardware configs
❌ Logs at this stage
❌ Anything redundant

If a screenshot doesn’t **prove a design decision**, it doesn’t belong.

---

## 7️⃣ Screenshot-to-Resume Mapping (Secret Sauce)

Each screenshot supports a bullet:

| Screenshot       | Resume Skill      |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Proxmox overview | Virtualization    |
| Firewall rules   | Network security  |
| Tiered OUs       | IAM / AD security |
| GPO baselines    | Policy hardening  |
| Backup server    | Resilience        |

This is why you’re doing this.

---

## 8️⃣ Suggested Commit Strategy

Don’t commit 30 screenshots at once.

Example commits:

```
Add Active Directory tiered OU screenshots
Add firewall alias and rule screenshots
Add Proxmox virtualization screenshots
```

Small, readable commits = professional signal.

## Want to Go Hands-On Next?

If you want, next we can:

* Walk through **your existing screenshots one by one** and decide keep / cut
* Insert screenshots **directly into each Markdown file**
* Do a final **Phase 1 “review like a hiring manager” pass**

Tell me which you want:
1️⃣ Review my existing screenshots
2️⃣ Embed screenshots into docs
3️⃣ Final Phase 1 polish & checklist
